        <p>
          <strong>GroupWish</strong> is a digital platform created to help people
          come together and celebrate meaningful moments through shared group
          cards. We make it easy for friends, families, and teams to express
          their thoughts in one beautifully organized place.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our idea was born from the belief that celebrations feel more special
          when everyone contributes. Instead of scattered messages across
          different apps, GroupWish brings every wish, note, and memory into a
          single personalized card.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          GroupWish allows users to create group cards for birthdays, farewells,
          anniversaries, work milestones, and many other occasions. Anyone can
          start a card, invite others, and collect messages without any
          technical effort.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Designed for Simplicity</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform is designed to be intuitive and accessible. Whether
          you're creating a card for a close friend or organizing a team
          message, GroupWish keeps the process smooth, fast, and enjoyable.
        </p>
